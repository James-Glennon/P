                <p>The Titanic, a British luxury passenger liner that sank on April 15, 1912, en route to New York from
                    Southampton, England, on its maiden voyage.

                    The largest and most luxurious ship afloat, the Titanic had a double-bottomed hull divided into 16
                    watertight compartments. Because four of these could be flooded without endangering its buoyancy, it
                    was considered unsinkable. Shortly before midnight on April 14, it collided with an iceberg
                    southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland; five compartments ruptured and the ship sank. Some 1,500 of
                    its 2,200 passengers died.</p>

                <p>The Titanic was the product of intense competition among rival shipping lines in the first half of
                    the 20th century. In particular, the White Star Line found itself in a battle for steamship primacy
                    with Cunard, a venerable British firm with two standout ships that ranked among the most
                    sophisticated and luxurious of their time
