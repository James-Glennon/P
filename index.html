            <p>The Titanic, a British luxury passenger liner that sank on April 15, 1912, en route to New York from
                Southampton, England, on its maiden voyage.

                The largest and most luxurious ship afloat, the Titanic had a double-bottomed hull divided into 16
                watertight compartments. Because four of these could be flooded without endangering its buoyancy, it
                was considered unsinkable. Shortly before midnight on April 14, it collided with an iceberg
                southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland; five compartments ruptured and the ship sank. Some 1,500 of
                its 2,200 passengers died.</p>

            <p>The Titanic was the product of intense competition among rival shipping lines in the first half of
                the 20th century. In particular, the White Star Line found itself in a battle for steamship primacy
                with Cunard, a venerable British firm with two standout ships that ranked among the most
                sophisticated and luxurious of their time;

                        A ship that began service in 1907 and soon after set the record for average speed during
                        a
                        transatlantic crossing, which it held for 22 years.</li>

                        also launched the same year and was lauded for its spectacular interiors. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The same year that Cunard unveiled its two magnificent liners, J. Bruce Ismay, chief executive of
                    White
                    Star, discussed the construction of three large ships with William J. Pirrie, chairman of the
                    shipbuilding company Harland and Wolff. Part of a new “Olympic” class of liners, each ship would
                    measure
                    882 feet in length and 92.5 feet at their broadest point, making them the largest of their time.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In March 1909, work began in the massive Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Ireland, on the
                    second
                    of these three ocean liners, Titanic, and continued nonstop for two years.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    On May 31, 1911, Titanic's immense hull-the largest movable manmade object in the world at the
                    time-made
                    its way down the slipways and into the River Lagan in Belfast. More than 100,000 people attended the
                    launching, which took just over a minute and went off without a hitch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hull was immediately towed to a mammoth fitting-out dock where thousands of workers would spend
                    most
                    of the next year building the ship's decks, constructing her lavish interiors and installing the 29
                    giant boilers that would power her two main steam engines.

            <p>
                After the success of Titanic's sea trials in Ireland, she made the short journey to Southampton, England
                for what would be both the maiden and final titanic voyage.
                <br>
                Titanic arrived in Southampton only two weeks before her maiden voyage which meant there was an
                incredible amount of pressure from White Star Lines to turn her from an Irish built ship into their most
                elegant British Royal Mail Steamer. Food, Linen and Furniture were thousands of other items were hauled
                aboard the Titanic around the clock and staff were selected and trained accordingly for their roles.
                <br>
                Captain Edward James Smith would be the man to steer Titanic to New York and was the perfect fit for the
                role due to his presence and stature for the media, experience from his crew and was a particular
                favourite of J. Bruce Ismay for all of these reasons.
                <br>
                Like nearly all other elements of Titanic's life thus far its departure was a successful event that was
                witnessed in large numbers by both the media and interested parties of all shapes, ages and walks of
                life.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Passengers on the Titanic paid significantly different prices for different accommodation options. The
                suites and cabins on the Titanic cost the passengers no small sum for the time. At approximately
                $100,000 in today's United States dollars, you can see why the world's richest and most elite sailed on
                the Titanic —
                only they could afford the parlour suites. For the immigrants who travelled in third class, a berth cost
                was no small sum either. The immigrants were poor, and raising that kind of money (approximately $350 to
                $900 in today's dollars) for passage to America was difficult in the early 1900s.
                <br>
                First-class passengers sipped wine and enjoyed cigars and hors d'oeuvres, whilst those on the lower
                decks were overcome with happiness and sadness at the prospect of entering a new life in the United
                States but also knowing they may never see their families or beloved England again.
                <br>
                The Titanic seemed to have everything on board, including its own newspaper. The Atlantic Daily Bulletin
                was printed every day on board the Titanic. The newspaper included news, advertisements, stock prices,
                horse-racing results, society gossip, and the day's menu.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Titanic had stopped in Cherbourg, France, to pick up additional passengers. Here, one of the most famous
                people on the ship boarded, John Jacob Astor IV. Astor was a colonel in the United States military and
                one of the richest people in the world at the time, with an estate worth roughly $87 million USD at the
                time. That is approximately equivilant to 2.4 billion as of 2021.
