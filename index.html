            <p>The Titanic, a British luxury passenger liner that sank on April 15, 1912, en route to New York from
                Southampton, England, on its maiden voyage.

                The largest and most luxurious ship afloat, the Titanic had a double-bottomed hull divided into 16
                watertight compartments. Because four of these could be flooded without endangering its buoyancy, it
                was considered unsinkable. Shortly before midnight on April 14, it collided with an iceberg
                southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland; five compartments ruptured and the ship sank. Some 1,500 of
                its 2,200 passengers died.</p>

                <p>The Titanic was the product of intense competition among rival shipping lines in the first half of
                    the 20th century. In particular, the White Star Line found itself in a battle for steamship primacy
                    with Cunard, a venerable British firm with two standout ships that ranked among the most
                    sophisticated and luxurious of their time;

                        A ship that began service in 1907 and soon after set the record for average speed during
                        a
                        transatlantic crossing, which it held for 22 years.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    The same year that Cunard unveiled its two magnificent liners, J. Bruce Ismay, chief executive of
                    White
                    Star, discussed the construction of three large ships with William J. Pirrie, chairman of the
                    shipbuilding company Harland and Wolff. Part of a new “Olympic” class of liners, each ship would
                    measure
                    882 feet in length and 92.5 feet at their broadest point, making them the largest of their time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In March 1909, work began in the massive Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Ireland, on the
                    second
                    of these three ocean liners, Titanic, and continued nonstop for two years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On May 31, 1911, Titanic's immense hull-the largest movable manmade object in the world at the
                    time-made
                    its way down the slipways and into the River Lagan in Belfast. More than 100,000 people attended the
                    launching, which took just over a minute and went off without a hitch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hull was immediately towed to a mammoth fitting-out dock where thousands of workers would spend
                    most
                    of the next year building the ship's decks, constructing her lavish interiors and installing the 29
                    giant boilers that would power her two main steam engines.

                <p>
                    After the success of Titanic's sea trials in Ireland, she made the short journey to Southampton,
                    England
                    for what would be both the maiden and final titanic voyage.
                    <br>
                    Titanic arrived in Southampton only two weeks before her maiden voyage which meant there was an
                    incredible amount of pressure from White Star Lines to turn her from an Irish built ship into their
                    most
                    elegant British Royal Mail Steamer. Food, Linen and Furniture were thousands of other items were
                    hauled
                    aboard the Titanic around the clock and staff were selected and trained accordingly for their roles.
                    <br>
                    Captain Edward James Smith would be the man to steer Titanic to New York and was the perfect fit for
                    the
                    role due to his presence and stature for the media, experience from his crew and was a particular
                    favourite of J. Bruce Ismay for all of these reasons.
                    <br>
                    Like nearly all other elements of Titanic's life thus far its departure was a successful event that
                    was
                    witnessed in large numbers by both the media and interested parties of all shapes, ages and walks of
                    life.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Passengers on the Titanic paid significantly different prices for different accommodation options.
                    The
                    suites and cabins on the Titanic cost the passengers no small sum for the time. At approximately
                    $100,000 in today's United States dollars, you can see why the world's richest and most elite sailed
                    on
                    the Titanic —
                    only they could afford the parlour suites. For the immigrants who travelled in third class, a berth
                    cost
                    was no small sum either. The immigrants were poor, and raising that kind of money (approximately
                    $350 to
                    $900 in today's dollars) for passage to America was difficult in the early 1900s.
                    <br>
                    First-class passengers sipped wine and enjoyed cigars and hors d'oeuvres, whilst those on the lower
                    decks were overcome with happiness and sadness at the prospect of entering a new life in the United
                    States but also knowing they may never see their families or beloved England again.
                    <br>
                    The Titanic seemed to have everything on board, including its own newspaper. The Atlantic Daily
                    Bulletin
                    was printed every day on board the Titanic. The newspaper included news, advertisements, stock
                    prices,
                    horse-racing results, society gossip, and the day's menu.

                    and
                    one of the richest people in the world at the time, with an estate worth roughly $87 million USD at

                    Originally, a lifeboat drill was scheduled to take place on board the Titanic on April 14, 1912 -
                    the
                    day the Titanic hit the iceberg. However, for an unknown reason, Captain Smith cancelled the drill.
                    Many
                    believe that had the drill taken place, more lives could have been saved.

                <p>
                    On the night of April 14, wireless operator Phillips was very busy sending chatty passenger's
                    messages
                    to Cape Race, Newfoundland, whence they could be relayed inland to friends and relatives. He
                    received a
                    sixth ice-warning that night, but didn't realize how close Titanic was to the warning position and
                    put
                    that message under a paperweight at his elbow. It never reached Captain Smith or the officer on the
                    bridge.
                    <br>
                    The Titanic sunk on Monday, April 15, 1912, at 2:20 am. Only two hours and forty minutes after she
                    struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean. The iceberg collision ripped open Titanic's hull in
                    several places, including her five watertight compartments. The rate at which Titanic sank was quite
                    rapid for a ship of such size.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Titanic carried 2224 people of all age, gender and social class that fateful night and only 710
                    escaped
                    in lifeboats who the RMS Carpathia later rescued. 1514 people died in the icy waters. The dead
                    mainly
                    consisted of men who offered their limited lifeboat spaces to the many women children on board. The
                    bulk
                    of those men who perished primarily came from the ship's second class passengers with ninety percent
                    of
                    these men perishing in the icy waters.<a href="#ref04"><span class="reference">[4]</span></a>

                <p>
                    The night was uncommonly clear and dark, moonless but faintly glowing with an incredible sky full of
                    stars by all accounts. The stars were so bright that one officer mistook the planet Jupiter (then
                    rising
                    just above the horizon) for a steamship light. The sea was, likewise, unusually calm and flat, “like
                    glass,” said many survivors. The lack of waves made it even more difficult to spot icebergs since no
                    tell-tale white water broke at the bergs' edges. The lookouts were questioning White Star personnel
                    as
                    to where their binoculars were. They were told that they were misplaced, which would play a role in
                    destroying the ship.<a href="#ref03"><span class="reference">[3]</span></a>

                        Dr Robert Ballard
                    </a>, a renowned oceanographer and underwater archaeologist and that sharp mass was the
                    bow of
                    the Titanic.
                    <br>
                    Within moments Ballard and his crew realized they were the first people to lay eyes on the Titanic
                    in
                    over 73 years as they confirmed portholes, cabins and items that correlated perfectly with
                    blueprints of
                    Titanic.<a href="#ref05"><span class="reference">[5]</span></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The RMS Titanic wreck lies at a depth of about 12,500 feet (3.8 km; 2.37 miles), about 370 miles
                    (600
                    km) south-southeast off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.
                    <br>
                    Ballard's first discovery was that the Titanic was not in one piece and was in a heavily rusted
                    state.
                    The Bow and stern were separated by approximately 640 meters (2000 feet.) which instantly ruined
                    some
                    misguided dreams of refloating her as a living museum. Scientists had theorized that due to the
                    ocean's
                    depths and temperature in the region that Titanic lay, it might have avoided the ravages of
                    corrosion,
                    wood disintegration, and possibly even may contain some well-preserved skeletons. This was not the
                    case.
