            <p>The Titanic, a British luxury passenger liner that sank on April 15, 1912, en route to New York from
                Southampton, England, on its maiden voyage.

                The largest and most luxurious ship afloat, the Titanic had a double-bottomed hull divided into 16
                watertight compartments. Because four of these could be flooded without endangering its buoyancy, it
                was considered unsinkable. Shortly before midnight on April 14, it collided with an iceberg
                southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland; five compartments ruptured and the ship sank. Some 1,500 of
                its 2,200 passengers died.</p>

            <p>The Titanic was the product of intense competition among rival shipping lines in the first half of
                the 20th century. In particular, the White Star Line found itself in a battle for steamship primacy
                with Cunard, a venerable British firm with two standout ships that ranked among the most
                sophisticated and luxurious of their time;
                <ul>
                    <li>The Mauretania</li>
                    <span> A ship that began service in 1907 and soon after set the record for average speed during
                        a
                        transatlantic crossing, which it held for 22 years.</span>
                    <li>and the Lusitania</li>
                    <span>also launched the same year and was lauded for its spectacular interiors.</span>
                </ul>
