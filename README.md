    A margin between the last paragraph element of the learn more section created a gap between the background colours of the main section and the footer, resulting in an uncovered line. After attempts to target this paragraph as a child of the h4 header with a paragraph sibling proved unsuccessful,

        h4 > p ~ p

    the footer was given a margin of minus 0.5 rem to cover the gap.
